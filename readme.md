## Countdown to MLB Opening Day 2019
# Developer: Danny Pifer

The purpose of this project was to make a timer that counts town to a given date. In our case, March 28th 2019, opening day for Major League Baseball. I used vanilla JS to populate the countdown timer, as well as the current date. This site is mobile responsive.
